Protect your site from spammers and bots with RIDENâ€™s "neighborhood watch".

== Description ==
RIDEN is cyber security that gains threat intelligence from a large community of users. The RIDEN community is a network of servers and websites that report attacks through the RIDEN service. Networks that are frequent nuisances get blocked by our plugin, while visitors from friendly networks are allowed to visit your site. It's better than geo-blocking: allow people from all over the world to see your content while keeping the bad stuff out.

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin through the plugins section of your WordPress administration page.
2. Activate it.
3. Enjoy enhanced protection!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I use RIDEN and WordFence at the same time?

Yes, and other security plugins too.

= What stage of development is RIDEN currently in?

A simpler version of RIDEN has been in use for over a decade. We are now making it available to more people in an effort to improve network security for everyone. This plugin and a few other parts of the RIDEN system are currently in beta.

= Is there any limit to the RIDEN service? Is there a cost involved?

No. Today there is no cost or limit to the service, and there will always be a free component to the RIDEN offering
because that's very important to us. However, in order to sustain the service as it grows, there may be higher level
SaaS offerings in the future which may place limits on the service for free users. As the community grows we will get
a better understanding on where best to place those limits so that everyone benefits.
